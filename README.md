# RD-O4MEGA-V1
 4MB Memory for Omega Home Computer

This is a memory module for the Omega Home Computer designed to better fit the printable cases available.  And should be considered a fork of: https://github.com/capsule5000/O4MEGA_v2

While Jordi did a good job on the design, it's just too large for the printable cases in my experience.  And because of this, I have redesigned the board using SMD components.  That said, this board should support either HM628512 or AS6C4008 SRAMs.  When matched with standard height male and female headers this provides ample clearance for socketed ICs.
